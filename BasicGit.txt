To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command:  - git init

Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. - touch Tundra.txt

After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.What this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called mnelson.txt, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it." - git status

So, how do you tell git which files to put into a commit? This is where the staging environment or index come in. To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add - git add Tundra.txt

run git status command to check changes. To reiterate, the file has not yet been added to a commit, but it's about to be.

Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the git commit command. - git commit -m "Your message about commit"




Let's say you are on the master branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run git checkout -b <my branch name>. - git checkout -b Greenland

After running the above command, you can use the git branch command to confirm that your branch was created: - git branch 

to change the brach use command  git checkout. The branch name with the asterisk next to it indicates which branch you're pointed to at that given time.- git checkout master

Now, if you switch back to the master branch and make some more commits, your new branch won't see any of those changes until you merge those changes onto your new branch.
